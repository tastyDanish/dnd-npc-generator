# enter-the-tavern

I've always hated building NPCs. There's so much writing and mental energy involved in creating a cool NPC character.

That's why I built this website. I want to have awesome and interesting NPCs without having to worry about the details.

Enter the tavern uses a markov chain style to building NPCs. 
As it's building the NPC the previous decisions will influence future ones.
